# the following deployment types are supported:
# devbox_type == 'vm_host':    prepare a libvirt VM host for devbox VM install
# devbox_type == 'host':       provision the host to become devbox
#     vm_type == 'libvirt':      use libvirt for kube-up
#     vm_type == 'virtualbox':   use VirtualBox for kube-up
# devbox_type == 'vm':         provision a devbox VM
#     vm_type == 'libvirt':      use libvirt (kube-up will spawn nested VMs)
#     vm_type == 'virtualbox':   use VirtualBox (kube-up will not work inside this VM)
